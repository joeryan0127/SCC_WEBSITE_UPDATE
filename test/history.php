                                        <p>The formative years were characterized by efforts to develop the 10 pupils who enrolled and the construction of buildings. The School population had increased in the succeeding years and in five years the school was considered in getting the name of Performing Arts Center of the South when it offered Summer Workshop classes in Music, Painting, Speech, etc. to its pupils including students from the other schools in the locality. However, it was also after thye 5th year that the founder decided to sell the school to the present owner, Mrs. Rosalina N. Go.</p>
                                        <p>The Preschool eventually grew bigger. It opened the Primary, Elementary, and upon the request of the parents, opened a complete High School. It was in June 2005, when it was registered with the Securities and Exchange Commeission (SEC) as a non-stock, non-profit corporation with the official name of St. Cecilia's College - Cebu, Inc. with Mrs. Maria de la Rosa, Principal. As the school increased its population, it had rented a space in the nearby area for the Elementary and High School as it continued to construct a 5-storey building- the St. La Salle building- at teh original area where the Preschool was located.</p>
                                        <p>The Elementary Department had its first graduation ceremony in March 2006 and the High School in March 2007 with 7 graduates.</p>
                                        <p>Eventually, the College Department was opened in June 2007 offering BEED, BSED, BSIT, BSHM, and BSBA degrees with only 7 students under the leadership of Mr. Alfredo Moreno, Jr., College Dean. The school was with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the name St. Cecilia's College-Cebu, Inc.</p>
                                        <p>The 6th storey of the building was constructed in December 2007. In June 2008, the Grade4-6, High School and College students occupied the new building.</p>
                                        <p>It was in July 2008 that the Preschool, Elementary, SPED, and the Secondary curriculum were granted Government Recognition by the Department of Education. In November 2008, Pensionne St. Cecilia which later became the laboratory facility for BSHM and BSTM was acquired. Presently, it is the Basic Home Econimics building.</p>
                                        <p>To further improve the quality of education and to produce globally competitive graduates, the school applied for assistance from the Lasallian Schools Supervision Office (LASSO) in February 2009, and was visited by a 3-member teamcomposed by Sr.Teresita C. Octavio, Dr. John T. Cabalo and Dr. Herminia D. Torres. Thereafter, ST. Cecilia's College-Cebu, Inc., was granted a Consultancy status by LASSO. Its services started with Br. Ophelia S. Fugoso AFSC, LASSO Supervisor, Ms. Isabel Macrina V. Encabo, Principal, College Dean and Mr. Mr. Mark Joel N. Go, President.</p>

                                        <p>The presence of LASSO brought rapid changes in the institution. The owners focused their attention on improving the school's facilities. The school administrators set organizational systems, promoting academic excellence and developing a holistic student program and practical outreach program for the poor children of the municipality.</p>

Then the 6th storey of the building which is the sky gym was added as an activity area aside from using it for sports and physical functions.</p>
                                        <p>It was in school year 2009-2010 that Christian Living (CL) was taught in the Basic Education Department and Religious Education (REED) in the College Department. The Campus Ministry office was then created.</p>
