                                <p>I spent my first and second year high school in SCC. When we moved to California, I enrolled in Oakdale High School. There were two of us from Cebu who transferred there and i was promoted to the next level. However, the other students who came from a different school in Cebu was sent back to grade 8. I'm in grade 12 now and i'm also an English Reading and Writing student teacher in Elementary.</p>

                                <p>I don't have any problem when i enrolled my two kids when we transferred in London UK. They didn't even ask me many questions and requirements when they knew that my children came from St. Cecilia's. Blanca was grade 6 in SCC and was accelerated to grade 8 now while Donna was grade 4 in SCC was also accelerated to grade 6. During the 1st term, Maria Donna got Golden Rule Award.</p>

                                <p>Our son, Lee Andrei-K1, was able to develop self-confidence, gregariousness and creativity; learn the habit of studying and doing assignments right after class; develop more understanding on the concept of right and wrong or good and bad; and realize the importance of always praying to God. In Science, he's able to classify plants and animals, develop appreciation for nature and life and recognize body parts and thier functions. In Math, he's able to identify colors and shapes, learn how to count and write numbers, In English, he can identify and write letters, read two or three-letter words and comprehend a story. At a young age, our son knows all of these and we are proud of him. We are also thankful to the teacher and to the school.</p>

                                <p>This has been a great year, being our first school year at St. Cecilia's College. In less than a year, we have noticed tremendous improvements in our children: Jhy Rosheene and J-Reanne. We can see them becoming more independent and more responsible. We can see that they have been working hard not only their extracurricular/co-curricular activities but in their academics as well. These areas have developed them socially, emotionally and intellectually and the religious activity, spiritually. There is balance and thus, has helped mold our children's personality and character. More importantly, we are happy that our children are happy at St. Cecilia's College.</p>
